The variation in the lattice parameter is attributed to the lattice strain induced by the introduction of Ce3+ due to the formation of oxygen vacancies. Lattice strain was observed to decrease with an increase in the particle size. Ce3+ ions concentration increased from 17% to 44% with the reduction in the particle size."
