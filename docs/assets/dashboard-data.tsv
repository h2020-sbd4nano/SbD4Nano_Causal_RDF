When the cells were treated with the lower dose (3 µg/cm2 for 24 h and 48 h) of ZnO-NPs a significant IL-8 release was revealed (Fig. 6A). Exposure to the higher ZnO-NPs concentration induced an amplified chemokine secretion. IL-8 release by cells treated with TiO2 at 3 µg/cm2 was comparable with control ones (Fig. 6B). The exposure of LoVo to 5 µg/cm2 of TiO2 particles stimulated a significant release of IL-8. The experimental results suggest that the release of IL-8 induced by TiO2 particles is due to the presence of a percentage of particles smaller than 100 nm in size distribution.

Accordingly, these two GO with same lateral area and surface properties could absorb equal amounts of IgG opsonin (Fig. S8).

Exposure to the higher ZnO-NPs concentration induced an amplified chemokine secretion. IL-8 release by cells treated with TiO2 at 3 µg/cm2 was comparable with control ones (Fig. 6B). The exposure of LoVo to 5 µg/cm2 of TiO2 particles stimulated a significant release of IL-8. The experimental results suggest that the release of IL-8 induced by TiO2 particles is due to the presence of a percentage of particles smaller than 100 nm in size distribution.

Examples of 'activation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process' are cytochrome c and Apaf1. When cytochrome c is released from mitochondria and forms a complex with Apaf1, they form a scaffolding platform in which the pro-caspase 9 is bound (the 'apoptosome'). The caspase is then cleaved and activated. Cytochrome c and Apaf1 are therefore involved in the conversion of the zymogen procaspase 9 to the active form of the caspase.

Data from MTT test showed that particles TiO2:SiO2 3:1, with a lower amount of SiO2 vs. TiO2, have affected the viability of the cells at the doses 750 and 75 µg/mL with a mortality of the 30% and 10%, respectively (Figure 4a). Cell viability data obtained from the exposure to TiO2 and SiO2 NPs alone are reported in Supplementary Materials (Figure S2). To investigate the type of cell death induced by these NPs, H/PI staining has been performed at the dose 75 µg TiO2/mL, which is the dose used for the other endpoints. Furthermore, this effective concentration falls in the range (from 1 µg/mL until 200 µg/mL) recommended for the in vitro testing of NMs aiming to investigate biological responses and in mechanistic studies [31,32]. Results from this test showed that TiO2:SiO2 3:1 induced a reduction of cell viability, as demonstrated by the increased number of necrotic cells (Figure 4b). 	https://doi.org/10.3390/nano9071041	1	0	Silica coating.	-

The increased specific surface area mainly results from the large specific surface area of SiO2 and nano size of TiO2/SiO2 Nc (15%). The TiO2/SiO2 Nc (15%) with a larger surface area can provide increased centers for absorption and photocatalytic reaction. In addition, high BET surface area is also clearly beneficial for contact between sample and bacteria lead to enhance the antibacterial ability.	https://doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2021.738969	0	0	-	-
