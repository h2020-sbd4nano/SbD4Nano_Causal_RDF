Cell viability data obtained from the exposure to TiO2 and SiO2 NPs alone are reported in Supplementary Materials (Figure S2). To investigate the type of cell death induced by these NPs, H/PI staining has been performed at the dose 75 µg TiO2/mL, which is the dose used for the other endpoints. Furthermore, this effective concentration falls in the range (from 1 µg/mL until 200 µg/mL) recommended for the in vitro testing of NMs aiming to investigate biological responses and in mechanistic studies [31,32]. Results from this test showed that TiO2:SiO2 3:1 induced a reduction of cell viability, as demonstrated by the increased number of necrotic cells (Figure 4b).",

However, biogenic rGO was found to be thicker (∼4.23 nm), indicating the presence of biomass on the GO surface.51",

The exposure of LoVo to 5 µg/cm2 of TiO2 particles stimulated a significant release of IL-8. The experimental results suggest that the release of IL-8 induced by TiO2 particles is due to the presence of a percentage of particles smaller than 100 nm in size distribution.

Exposure to the higher ZnO-NPs concentration induced an amplified chemokine secretion. IL-8 release by cells treated with TiO2 at 3 µg/cm2 was comparable with control ones (Fig. 6B). The exposure of LoVo to 5 µg/cm2 of TiO2 particles stimulated a significant release of IL-8. The experimental results suggest that the release of IL-8 induced by TiO2 particles is due to the presence of a percentage of particles smaller than 100 nm in size distribution.

The GO of both sizes entered lysosomes for excretion. Using both sizes of GO, almost no inhibition of cell proliferation was found at doses up to 100 μg/mL.44 The size range of GO was reported to be from 1.8 ± 0.9 nm to 9.1 ± 7.1 nm, the latter is due to protein coating.44",

When the cells were treated with the lower dose (3 µg/cm2 for 24 h and 48 h) of ZnO-NPs a significant IL-8 release was revealed (Fig. 6A). Exposure to the higher ZnO-NPs concentration induced an amplified chemokine secretion. IL-8 release by cells treated with TiO2 at 3 µg/cm2 was comparable with control ones (Fig. 6B). The exposure of LoVo to 5 µg/cm2 of TiO2 particles stimulated a significant release of IL-8. The experimental results suggest that the release of IL-8 induced by TiO2 particles is due to the presence of a percentage of particles smaller than 100 nm in size distribution. It has been demonstrated that TiO2 nanoparticles induce oxidative stress and release of IL8",
