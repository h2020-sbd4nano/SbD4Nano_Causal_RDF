When the cells were treated with the lower dose (3 µg/cm2 for 24 h and 48 h) of ZnO-NPs a significant IL-8 release was revealed (Fig. 6A). Exposure to the higher ZnO-NPs concentration induced an amplified chemokine secretion. IL-8 release by cells treated with TiO2 at 3 µg/cm2 was comparable with control ones (Fig. 6B). The exposure of LoVo to 5 µg/cm2 of TiO2 particles stimulated a significant release of IL-8. The experimental results suggest that the release of IL-8 induced by TiO2 particles is due to the presence of a percentage of particles smaller than 100 nm in size distribution. It has been demonstrated that TiO2 nanoparticles induce oxidative stress and release of IL8	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2010.04.012	1	A morphology quality inhering in a bearer by virtue of the bearer's physical magnitude.

Accordingly, these two GO with same lateral area and surface properties could absorb equal amounts of IgG opsonin (Fig. S8). Interaction between the FcγR and IgG was proportional to the IgG absorption. Therefore, GO sheets differed greatly in size would be internalized by macrophages at a similar level through IgG-FcγR meditated phagocytosis.	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.02.021	0	A morphology quality inhering in a bearer by virtue of the bearer's physical magnitude.

E.g. exposure to cigarette smoke	This term should be used when the annotation refers to a process that occurs in a context of apoptotic cell death. To annotate gene products involved in activation of cysteine-type endopeptidases in other cellular process (e.g., cell cycle arrest) that do not necessarily develop into an apoptotic process, please use the more general parent term GO:0097202. Examples of 'activation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process' are cytochrome c and Apaf1. When cytochrome c is released from mitochondria and forms a complex with Apaf1, they form a scaffolding platform in which the pro-caspase 9 is bound (the 'apoptosome'). The caspase is then cleaved and activated. Cytochrome c and Apaf1 are therefore involved in the conversion of the zymogen procaspase 9 to the active form of the caspase.
