Accordingly, these two GO with same lateral area and surface properties could absorb equal amounts of IgG opsonin (Fig. S8). Interaction between the FcγR and IgG was proportional to the IgG absorption. Therefore, GO sheets differed greatly in size would be internalized by macrophages at a similar level through IgG-FcγR meditated phagocytosis.

It is also synthesized by endothelial cells, which store IL-8 in their storage vesicles, the Weibel-Palade bodies. IL-8 is secreted and is an important mediator of the immune reaction in the innate immune system response.	size	A morphology quality inhering in a bearer by virtue of the bearer's physical magnitude.	negatively_correlates	interleukin-8 measurement	As shown in Figs. 6A and B, in the supernatants of untreated cells there was a low content of IL-8. When the cells were treated with the lower dose (3 µg/cm2 for 24 h and 48 h) of ZnO-NPs a significant IL-8 release was revealed (Fig. 6A). Exposure to the higher ZnO-NPs concentration induced an amplified chemokine secretion. IL-8 release by cells treated with TiO2 at 3 µg/cm2 was comparable with control ones (Fig. 6B). The exposure of LoVo to 5 µg/cm2 of TiO2 particles stimulated a significant release of IL-8. The experimental results suggest that the release of IL-8 induced by TiO2 particles is due to the presence of a percentage of particles smaller than 100 nm in size distribution. It has been demonstrated that TiO2 nanoparticles induce oxidative stress and release of IL8

In graphs of the electron band structure of solids, the band gap generally refers to the energy difference (in electron volts) between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band in insulators and semiconductors. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_gap]	Oxygen vacancies	Point defects in the bulk or surface of a material	positively_correlates	energy band gap	Moreover, interface states caused by oxygen vacancies also effectively lower the band gap

The particles are initially contained within phagocytic vacuoles (phagosomes), which then fuse with primary lysosomes to effect digestion of the particles.	Fc-gamma receptor signaling pathway involved in phagocytosis	An Fc-gamma receptor signaling pathway that contributes to the endocytic engulfment of external particulate material by phagocytes.	positively_correlates	phagocytosis	In contrast, a significant uptake reduction was found after blocking the Fcγ receptor with IgG antibody, revealing a key role of the FcγR-mediated phagocytic pathway in GO entry.
