When the cells were treated with the lower dose (3 µg/cm2 for 24 h and 48 h) of ZnO-NPs a significant IL-8 release was revealed (Fig. 6A). Exposure to the higher ZnO-NPs concentration induced an amplified chemokine secretion. IL-8 release by cells treated with TiO2 at 3 µg/cm2 was comparable with control ones (Fig. 6B). The exposure of LoVo to 5 µg/cm2 of TiO2 particles stimulated a significant release of IL-8. The experimental results suggest that the release of IL-8 induced by TiO2 particles is due to the presence of a percentage of particles smaller than 100 nm in size distribution.
