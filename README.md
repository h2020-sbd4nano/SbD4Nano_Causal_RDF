# Exposing causal links in nanosafety literature with semantic web technologies (working title)

This repository contains links to supporting data for the SbD4Nano network linking pchem properties of nanomaterials with stated biological outcomes in literature and the necessary files to map and verify their RDF graphs.
- Cases (TBD:put together in a single spreadsheet?):
    - Review
    - TiO2@SiO2 nanocomposite material
    - GO
- [YARRRML mapping files](/src/mapping)
- [Shape Expressions (ShEx)](/src/shapes)

The methodology to generate RDF versions of the curated spreadsheets was adapted from _Ammar Ammar. (2023). ammar257ammar/Nano-MIE-interactions-RDF: v1.0 (v1.0). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8075705_.
